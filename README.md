**Own Definition of Big Data:**
My own definition of big data is that it involves enormous data generated from various sources like social media, research papers, websites, and more, in an unstructured and messy format. This data can be transformed into clean and structured data using big data tools like Hadoop and Spark. This clean data can be utilized to derive useful information that benefits humans.
