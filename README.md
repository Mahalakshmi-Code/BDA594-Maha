### Own defination of big data- 
* My own defination of big data is that the enoromous data generated from various sources like social media, research papers, websites and many more in an unstructured and messy format, which can be transformed into clean and structured data by using big data tools like hadoop, spark. This clean data  can be utilised to draw useful 
information which helps humans. *
